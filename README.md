This is a standalone executable application, which is able to store the information of Book.
The application was built by two parts, the frontend, and backend. 
For the frontend, I used the Tkinter to build the graphical user interface, including button, entry widget, list box, scrollbar, and label. 
All components have their own functionality. 
For the backend, I used SQLite as the database to store the data. It allows users to do SQL operation, including view all, select, update, delete and insert. 

This is how graphical user interface look like.
