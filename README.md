This is a standalone executable application, which is able to store the information of Book.
The application was built by two parts, the frontend, and backend. 
For the frontend, I used the Tkinter to build the graphical user interface, including button, entry widget, list box, scrollbar, and label. 
All components have their own functionality. 
For the backend, I used SQLite as the database to store the data. It allows users to do SQL operation, including view all, select, update, delete and insert.
